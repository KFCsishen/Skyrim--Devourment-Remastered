Nonamz Multiprey addon is much more stable now. 
It's however very overpowered and will increase the height of your character at full weight requireing console commands to lower.
It also has a sped up digestion speed which is why im leaving it as optional.
If you set digestion speed to anything other then 250 seconds, the belly will turn into a massive torpedo and block out the sun.

To install this merge the data folder and overwrite the 4 scripts.

To uninstall overwrite with the original downloaded scripts folder.
