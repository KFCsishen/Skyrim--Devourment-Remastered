Select 1 of the 4 meshes you want to use.

Size ranges from Original, Larger, Massive (recommended) and Gigantic.

Drag the "Meshes" folder of the belly you want to use into your Data folder.

Start Skyrim and enjoy.

If you want to revert back to the older belly mesh, use the mesh titled, "Original".
